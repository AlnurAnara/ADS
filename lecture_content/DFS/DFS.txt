Depth-First Search (DFS)  tc based on the methods u used(matrix,adj-list)

DFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm 
that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Unlike BFS which explores level by level, 
DFS goes deep into the graph before exploring neighbors.

use stack or recursion 
use cases: Cycle detection, topological sort, path finding

        0
       / \
      1   2
     / \   \
    3   4   5

Visit order: 0 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5

Path taken:
1. Start at 0
2. Go to 1 (first neighbor of 0)
3. Go to 3 (first neighbor of 1)
4. Backtrack to 1
5. Go to 4 (second neighbor of 1)
6. Backtrack to 0
7. Go to 2 (second neighbor of 0)
8. Go to 5 (first neighbor of 2)


G={
    A:[B]
    B:[A,C,D]
    C:[K,B,F]
    D:[B,E,F]
    E:[D,F]
    F:[C,D,E]
    K:[C]
}


DFS(G)
set<char>v;
stack<char>st;
for(auto&e : G){  // this for loop is used to check the unconnected components
    if(!v.count(e.first)){
        st.push(e.first);
       dfs_helper(G,st);
    }
}

dfs_helper(G,st)
    while(!st.empty()){
        c=st.top(); //the node which is to be visited
        st.pop();
        v.insert(c); 
    }

    for(auto&e : G[c]){
        if(!v.count(e)){
            st.push(e);
            dfs_helper(G,st);
        }
    }

differences between BFS And DFS
BFS                                DFS
queue                              stake            
Explore level by level             Go as deep as possible along one path, then backtrack   
from the source                                   
Always finds shortest path         ❌ Does not guarantee shortest path
                                   
                                    Use DFS when:
                                    Finding cycles
                                    Topological sorting
                                    Finding strongly connected components
                                    Solving puzzles with backtracking
                                    Memory is limited (DFS uses less space for wide graphs)
                                    Exploring all paths


                                    topological sort is used for directed acyclic graph 



Use BFS when:

Finding shortest path (unweighted)
Level-order traversal
Finding distance from source
Finding if two vertices are connected in minimum steps
Graph is very deep
