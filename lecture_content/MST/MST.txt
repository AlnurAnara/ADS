Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph (G = (V, E)), 
a spanning tree is a subgraph that:
Includes all vertices in (V)
Is a tree (no cycles)
Has exactly (|V| - 1) edges

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is the spanning tree 
with the smallest possible total edge weight. 
An MST has exactly (|V| - 1) edges and no cycles.

the differences between kruskal and Prim
Kruskal:“Pick the smallest edges globally, one by one, as long as they don’t form a cycle.”

Prim:“Grow a tree from a starting vertex, always adding the cheapest edge from the tree to a new vertex.”

| Aspect                     | **Kruskal’s Algorithm**                                  | **Prim’s Algorithm**                                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic strategy             | Sort **all edges** and add the smallest “safe” edges     | Start from one vertex and **grow** the MST step by step          |
| Grows…                     | A **forest** that gradually merges into one tree         | A single **tree**, starting from an arbitrary root               |
| Main data structure        | **Disjoint Set Union (DSU / Union-Find)** + sorted edges | **Priority queue (min-heap)** or array of `key[]` + `used[]`     |
| Input format best suited   | **Edge list**                                            | **Adjacency list** or **matrix**                                 |
| Cycle detection            | Using DSU: `find(u) == find(v)` ⇒ cycle                  | Implicitly avoided: only connect to vertices not yet in tree     |
| Order of decisions         | Global: by **edge weights only**                         | Local: by **closest vertex to current tree**                     |
| Complexity (typical)       | (O(E \log E))                                            | (O(E \log V)) with heap, (O(V^2)) with matrix                    |
| Better for…                | **Sparse graphs**, many edges stored as a list           | **Dense graphs**, or when graph given as adjacency matrix/list   |
| Handles disconnected graph | Produces a **minimum spanning forest**                   | Standard version assumes connected; otherwise, multiple runs     |
| Conceptual similarity      | Like **sorting edges** + greedy                          | Like **Dijkstra without distances**, but using edge weights only |
