topological sort is used to directed acyclic（without cyclic graph 



A-> B-> D-> E
    |   |   /
    to  to to   
K ->C -> F   
            H

the stack must have the same direction
i.e. ABKCDEFH  are pointing to the right

we can use traverse 
F E D C B A K H 
bc this array are pointing to the right
and reverse this array to get the topological sorted array 
H K B C D E F A


DFS(G)
set<char>v;
vector<char>a;

void dfsRecursive(int node, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& graph, unordered_set<int>& visited) {
    // Mark node as visited and process it
    visited.insert(node);
    
    // Visit all unvisited neighbors
    for (auto neighbor : graph[node]) {
        if (!visited.count(neighbor)) {
            dfsRecursive(neighbor, graph, visited);
        }
    }

    a.push_back(node);
    reverse(a);
}


for(auto&e : G){  // this for loop is used to check the unconnected components
    if(!v.count(e.first)){
        dfsRecursive(e.first,G);
    }
}
