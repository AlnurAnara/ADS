Kruskal's Algorithm: finds the minimum spanning tree
(1).Definition
start with the smallest weight edge ,skipping edges that would create a cycle. 
A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) (also called Union-Find) quickly detects cycles.

(2).Steps
1.Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of weight.
2.Initialize DSU so each vertex is its own set.
3.For each edge (u, v, w) in order:
    * If find(u) != find(v), add the edge to the MST and union the sets.
    * Stop when (|V| - 1) edges are chosen.

(3).Time complecity:O(E logE)
