In Rabin–Karp, when the hash of a text substring equals the hash of the pattern,
Compare the substring and pattern character by character to confirm


Given:

Text string s1 (length n)
Pattern string s2 (length m)
Find all occurrences of s2 in s1.

Time complexity :O(n+m)

Idea:

Compute hash of pattern s2
Compute prefix hashes of text s1
For each position i, compare hash of substring with pattern hash
Only compare actual strings if hashes match (to handle collisions)





what is rolling hash!!! check it
